            The area east of First Avenue between
Houston and 14th Street is called Alphabet City because the
lettered avenues are named Avenue A, B, C, and D. Until about
1998, this section of the East Village resisted gentrification.

            I opened this candy store in 1979 when this neighborhood was
really in trouble. Although things have changed for the better,
I still care about the children who live around here and I've al-
ways tried to keep the neighborhood kids away from drugs.

            Their storefront on Avenue B is Raul’s Candy Store’s third location in the area, and they have spent the last 20 years or so doling out gummy eggs and airheads to happy customers. But more than just a candy shop, Raul’s Candy Store was like a second home to many.

            Willy Guzman, 56, said he has patronized the store for more than 20 years, and used to hang out there after work and on weekends. Guzman said the regulars would take turns preparing meals — it was his turn last week, he made lasagna — and even spend holidays at the shop. <br><br>

"We used to come and play dominoes over there," said the Alphabet City resident. "Everybody’s sad … It’s going to be strange for everybody."
