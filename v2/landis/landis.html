          <h3>
            The current owner, Ray Patel, bought the store in 1986. Gem Spa is
            famous for its egg creams, a quintessential New York beverage
            originally served in candy stores throughout the Lower East Side
            beginning in the 1920's.

          <h4>
            GEM SPA HAS BEEN AN EAST VILLAGE INSTITUTION FOR DECADES, HERALDED
            AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE EGG CREAM AND KNOWN FOR BEING THE THE
            BACKGROUND TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S PUNK ROCK YEARS.
          </h4>
          <h3>
            The egg cream does not contain eggs or cream but is a mixture of
            very cold milk, seltzer, and flavored syrup. The Gem Spa owners have
            al- ways kept their milk in the ice cream freezer because one of the
            keys to making a great egg cream is to use extremely cold milk. It's
            also 'all in the way you stir it.' Because most of the original soda
            fountain locations have closed, true egg creams are rapidly
            disappearing.

            UNTIL 2020, GEM SPA CONTINUED TO MAKE THEIR EGG CREAMS USING THE

          </h4>
          <h3>
            The countermen learned to make egg creams from the previous owner
            who learned from the previous owner before him. The chocolate,
            vanilla, and coffee-flavored syrups were once made in the basement
            by the store's original owner.

          <h3>
            On May 7, 2020, owner Parul Patel announced that the physical store
            would not re-open due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
            rent increases, despite community efforts and a social media
            campaign to keep it open.

            soda, candy, chips. Health wise, people stopped eating this stuff.
            Whatever they’re ordering, they’re ordering on Amazon and get
            delivered to their door. It’s cheaper. New Yorkers want convenience,
            and they want to save money... The people who live here, they love
            us, but they’re not going to walk five blocks to come and buy their
            cigarettes here, or their soda. They’re not even going to walk one
            block if there’s a guy in the middle. That’s just how New York is. ”
