            ThE store was originally located down the street on East 7th
Street and I moved to this Second Avenue location in 1983. An
employee painted the sign and the storefront with a colorful
pattern in 1990.

            It endured as a psychedelic oasis even as the hippies disappeared and the neighborhood, the East Village, was transformed into a pricier and less scruffy place by the real estate boom that washed across many parts of New York City.

            The store displays retro toys and objects evoking nostalgia across generations. There are bellbottoms and platform shoes from the ’60s, Fraggle Rock toys and Smurfs that came free with McDonald’s children’s meals, old Playboy magazines, metal lunch boxes and copies of Life magazine.

            But that is only one reason Love Saves the Day is shutting its doors. Mr. Herson said the death in August of his wife, Leslie Herson, 65, who started the store, left it without its soul. “It’s hard to carry on without her,” said Mr. Herson, who will continue running a second store with the same name in New Hope, Pa.

            This East Village neighborhood
has changed so much over the years and is not really a neigh-
borhood anymore as far as the people are concerned. There
used to be lots of mom and pop stores in the area and neigh-
borhood people would shop in them but most of the shops have
been forced to close because rents have gotten really high.

             Now
the East Village is more upscale and larger chain stores have
opened. New people are constantly moving into the neighbor-
hood and it's even become a tourist destination.
