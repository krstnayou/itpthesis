            “It hasn’t changed since then,” he said. “Once, I was going to redo
            the storefront, but my accountant said, ‘Why? Then the landlord will
            expect a new ceiling, new walls, new everything.’ And I’m glad I

            Produce was displayed beautifully on angled stands and atop wooden
            crates that line both sides of the store. Two scales still hang from
            the ceiling, just in case of a power outage, said Cortese’s son,
            John. Original Sunkist advertisements, old-school product labels
            that John saved, and a plethora of vintage photographs decorated the
            store.

            “I never considered this work,” Cortese says, looking around the
            store, where most of the displays sit empty. Bags of fruit rest next
            to him on the shelf, but he’s not in a hurry to tend to them. “Even
            to this day, it’s just a hobby,” Cortese says.
