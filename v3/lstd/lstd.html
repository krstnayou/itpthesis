                404: Forget Me Not is a project by Kristina You created as her
                thesis project at NYU's ITP program in 2023. It is a project
                about human stories, New York Cities, the effects of
                gentrification, and preservation of memories. It tells the story
                of five select NYC stores that have served neighborhoods for
                countless years but have or on the verge of disappearing. 404
                was created as an attempt to create a space for the stories that
                were created at these locations to live on forever if only on
                the web.

        The store was originally located down the street on East 7th Street and
        I moved to this Second Avenue location in 1983. An employee painted the
        sign and the storefront with a colorful pattern in 1990.

        The store displays retro toys and objects evoking nostalgia across
        generations. There are bellbottoms and platform shoes from the ’60s,
        Fraggle Rock toys and Smurfs that came free with McDonald’s children’s
        meals, old Playboy magazines, metal lunch boxes and copies of Life
        magazine.

        But that is only one reason Love Saves the Day is shutting its doors.
        Mr. Herson said the death in August of his wife, Leslie Herson, 65, who
        started the store, left it without its soul. “It’s hard to carry on
        without her,” said Mr. Herson, who will continue running a second store
        with the same name in New Hope, Pa.
