                404: Forget Me Not is a project by Kristina You created as her
                thesis project at NYU's ITP program in 2023. It is a project
                about human stories, New York Cities, the effects of
                gentrification, and preservation of memories. It tells the story
                of five select NYC stores that have served neighborhoods for
                countless years but have or on the verge of disappearing. 404
                was created as an attempt to create a space for the stories that
                were created at these locations to live on forever if only on
                the web.

        Joe DiMaggio and his wife at the time, Marilyn Monroe, would drop by
        after a dinner at the nearby restaurant Gino (which closed in 2010).
        Throughout, beer prices never broke the $6 mark. And the battered
        banquettes and tiled floor were treated to a dust-to-dust approach to
        upkeep.

        Its walls and tables absorbed decades of smoke, beer and heaven knows
        what else as it offered an after-work haven to construction workers,
        sales clerks and executives. And like all things that gave this city
        character, it fell victim to a hot real estate market.

        Along with his son, Steven, Marcello Salinas started a petition to save
        Subway Inn, and while he did not succeed in sparing the bar’s 143 E 60th
        Street location, in December 2014 they announced that they had found a

        Once the bar closed, it was demolished along with properties from 143 to

        million.Once it closed, Subway Inn took its neon sign along with the
        booth shared by Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio, and moved several
        blocks east, to 1140 Second Avenue, at East 60th Street.
