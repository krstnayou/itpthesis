                It is a project about human stories, New York Cities, the
                effects of gentrification, and preservation of memories. It
                tells the story of five select NYC stores that have served
                neighborhoods for countless years but have or on the verge of
                disappearing. 404 was created as an attempt to create a space
                for the stories that were created at these locations to live on
                forever if only on the web.

        The last owner, Ray Patel, bought the store in 1986. Gem Spa is famous

        GEM SPA HAS BEEN AN EAST VILLAGE INSTITUTION FOR DECADES, HERALDED AS

      <h6>
        The egg cream does not contain eggs or cream but is a mixture of very
        cold milk, seltzer, and flavored syrup. The Gem Spa owners have al- ways
        kept their milk in the ice cream freezer because one of the keys to
        making a great egg cream is to use extremely cold milk. It's also 'all
        in the way you stir it.' Because most of the original soda fountain
        locations have closed, true egg creams are rapidly disappearing.

        The countermen learned to make egg creams from the previous owner who
        learned from the previous owner before him. The chocolate, vanilla, and
        coffee-flavored syrups were once made in the basement by the store's
        original owner.

        On May 7, 2020, owner Parul Patel announced that the physical store
        would not re-open due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and rent
        increases, despite community efforts and a social media campaign to keep
        it open.
